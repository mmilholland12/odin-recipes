            <li>2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons flaxseed meal</li>
            <li>2 cups all-prupose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup pumpkin puree</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons coconut oil</li>
            <li>1/4 cup toasted chopped pecans</li>

        <h2>Steps to Make</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine almond milk and vinegar together in a measuring cup; set aside for 10 minutes. </li>
            <li>Combine water and flaxseed meal together in a bowl; allow to rest until gelatinous, about 5 minutes. </li>
            <li>Combine flour, coconut sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl. </li>
            <li>Add almond milk mixture, flaxseed meal mixture, pumpkin puree, and coconut oil to the bowl with the flour mixture. Mix until well blended. Fold in pecans. </li>
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter. </li>
